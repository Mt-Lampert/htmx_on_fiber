# htmx_on_fiber

This is a learning project. It follows the project in the _HTMX Bible_ starting
at [Chapter 3](https://hypermedia.systems/a-web-1-0-application/). However,
instead of doing it with Python and _Flask,_ I'm going to try [Go
Fiber](https://gofiber.io/) and [Go
Templates](https://docs.gofiber.io/template/html/) from the beginning.
Moreover, I'm going to use [SQLc](https://sqlc.dev/) and [SQLite 3]() for
storing the data.

Yes, I know, it's a challenge to bring it all together, but I really think it's
worth it.

As I usually do it, I will keep a Journal to keep track of my progress, my
struggles and my insights.
